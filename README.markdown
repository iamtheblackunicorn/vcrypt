# VCRYPT :ribbon: :scroll: :lock:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/vcrypt/actions/workflows/vue.yml/badge.svg)

***A small Vue.js app for symmetric binary encryption.*** :ribbon: :scroll: :lock:

## ABOUT :books:

A while ago, I wrote a small library for Node.js that allows users to convert base 10 numbers into base 2 numbers. I thought I'd make a shiny frontend for it and use Vue for this frontend. This is the product of my labours. Enjoy. :heart_on_fire:

## USAGE :hammer:

***VCrypt*** is very simple to use! You can decrypt or encrypt text as a bunch of binary numbers. To switch between the modes, click the `Switch Mode` button. To encrypt lowercase text without any punctuation and make it hard for hackers to crack, you want to scramble the letters by some factor. To control this factor, press the `Increment` or `Decrement` buttons, respectively.
